# AI ChatBot

This Python script implements a simple AI chatbot using the `langchain_ollama` and `langchain_core` libraries. The chatbot maintains a conversation history and answers user questions based on the context provided.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required libraries: `langchain_ollama`, `langchain_core`

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run the following commands:

```bash
pip install langchain_ollama langchain_core
```

## Usage

Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

The chatbot will greet you and wait for your input. Type your question and press Enter. Type `exit` to quit the chatbot.

## Source

This script is based on a tutorial from YouTube: [Building a Chatbot with Langchain and Ollama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0o89z134CQ&t=227s)

## Example Interaction

```
Welcome to the AI ChatBot! Type 'exit' to quit.
You: How are you?
Bot: I am an AI model, so I don't have feelings, but I'm here to help you!
You: What is the capital of France?
Bot: The capital of France is Paris.
You: exit
```

Feel free to modify the script and improve the chatbot as needed.
